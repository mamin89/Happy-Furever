   <p style="text-align: center; font-weight:700px; font-style:oblique;"> Founded in 2024, Happy Furever began with a simple mission: to provide a safe haven for abandoned, neglected, and homeless animals in our community. What started as a small group of passionate animal lovers quickly grew into a dedicated team committed to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming animals in need. From the very first rescue to today, our shelter has been a beacon of hope for countless pets, offering them not just food and shelter, but love, care, and a second chance at life.

    As we’ve grown, so has our impact. Thanks to the support of our volunteers, donors, and local partners, Happy Furever has expanded its services to include medical care, behavioral training, and community outreach programs that promote responsible pet ownership. Every animal that walks through our doors has a story, and our mission is to help them write a new, happier chapter. Together, we’re not just saving lives—we’re building a compassionate community where every animal is valued and every home has the chance to be filled with unconditional love.
